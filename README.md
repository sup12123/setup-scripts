# setup-scripts
basically where I put all my setup scripts. I'll add more for more operating systems as I need them.

so far I have scripts for the following operating systems:

- Debian (desktop setup)
- Debian (server setup)

As I use them more I will probably make the end setup more customizable, but I just need some quick stuff now.
